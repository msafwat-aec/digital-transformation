# CS50 Homepage Project - Mohamed Safwat
**Specification File**
+---------------+
## What I Built
+---------------+
I made a personal portfolio website for my CS50 homepage project.
It's about me (Mohamed Safwat) and shows my work experience in digital transformation and BIM technology.
I thought this would be a good way to practice web development while also creating something useful for my career.

+----------------------------------+
## HTML Tags I Used (10+ required)
+----------------------------------+
Here are the HTML tags I used in my website:
1. <nav> - for the navigation menu at the top
2. <section> - to divide content into different parts
3. <div> - for grouping elements together
4. <img> - for pictures and icons
5. <form> - for the contact form
6. <input> - for text boxes in the form
7. <textarea> - for the message box
8. <select> - for dropdown menus
9. <button> - for clickable buttons
10. <footer> - for the bottom part of pages
11. <header> - for the top section
12. <main> - for the main content area
13. <article> - for project descriptions
14. <aside> - for side information
15. <ul> and <li> - for lists


+-------------------------------------+
## CSS Properties I Used (5+ required)
+-------------------------------------+
The CSS properties I used most:
1. background-color - to change background colors
2. font-family - to set different fonts
3. margin - for spacing around elements
4. padding - for spacing inside elements
5. border-radius - to make rounded corners
6. box-shadow - to add shadows and depth
7. display: flex - for flexible layouts
8. colo` - to change text colors

+----------+
## My Pages
+----------+
I created 4 HTML pages:
- **index.html** - The main homepage with my intro
- **about.html** - More details about my background and education
- **projects.html** - Shows my work projects and achievements
- **contact.html** - Has a contact form and my contact info

You can navigate between all pages using the menu at the top.

+----------------------+
## How I Used Bootstrap
+----------------------+
I used Bootstrap to make my website look professional and work on phones. Some Bootstrap things I used:
- The grid system (like `col-md-6`) to make columns
- Navigation bar component that collapses on mobile
- Card components to display my projects nicely
- Button styles to make buttons look better
- Form styling to make the contact form look clean

I added Bootstrap by including the CDN links in the <head> section of my HTML files.

+---------------------+
## JavaScript Features
+---------------------+
I added JavaScript to make the contact form work better. When someone fills out the form, it:
- Checks if the email looks correct (has @ and a dot)
- Makes sure all required fields are filled
- Shows an alert message when the form is submitted
- Clears the form after submission

I'm still learning JavaScript so I kept it simple, but it makes the site more interactive than just static HTML.

## Responsive Design
I tried to make sure the website works on both computers and phones.
I used Bootstrap's responsive classes and also wrote some CSS media queries.
The navigation menu turns into a hamburger menu on small screens, and the layout changes to stack vertically on mobile devices.

+----------------+
## What I Learned
+----------------+
This project taught me a lot about:
- How HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together
- Using Bootstrap to make responsive websites
- Form validation with JavaScript
- CSS flexbox and grid layouts
- Making websites accessible

+---------------------+
## Files in My Project
+---------------------+
- index.html - Homepage
- about.html - About me page
- projects.html - My projects
- contact.html - Contact form
- styles.css - My custom CSS
- specification.txt - This file

=====================
## Challenges I Faced
=====================
The hardest part was getting the responsive design to work right.
I had to learn about CSS media queries and Bootstrap's grid system.
Also, making the JavaScript form validation work took some trial and error because I'm still new to JavaScript.

Overall, I'm happy with how it turned out! It's my first real website and I learned a lot doing it.
I'm actually thinking about making this my final project after I develop it more and add more features.
